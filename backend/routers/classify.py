    **Automates the classification of incident tickets based on their description.**

    This endpoint takes a free-text description of an IT issue and uses an AI model
    to predict the most appropriate category for the ticket. This helps in
    automating initial ticket routing and streamlining the support process.

    **Model Implementation Details:**
    The system prioritizes using a **DistilBERT model** (via HuggingFace Transformers pipeline)
    for higher accuracy in understanding natural language. If the `transformers` library
    is not installed or the DistilBERT model fails to load (e.g., due to missing API keys
    for custom models or network issues), it falls back to a **TF-IDF Vectorizer
    combined with a Logistic Regression classifier**. The TF-IDF + LogReg model is
    trained on a small synthetic dataset upon startup as a robust fallback.

    **Scaling to Multiple Categories:**
    -   **Training Data:** To accurately classify across various categories (e.g., hardware, software, network, security), the AI model requires a diverse and sufficiently large dataset of historical tickets, each labeled with its correct category.
    -   **DistilBERT/Transformers:** For DistilBERT, this means fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on your specific ticket dataset. The model learns to understand the nuances of descriptions within each category. The `transformers` library handles this efficiently.
    -   **TF-IDF + LogReg:** For the TF-IDF approach, the `TfidfVectorizer` learns the importance of words/phrases within your categories, and `LogisticRegression` then maps these vectorized descriptions to the most likely category based on patterns learned from the labeled data.
    -   **Dynamic Category Management:** In a production system, categories could be managed in the database, and the classification model retrained periodically (or on-demand) with new data reflecting updated categories or changing incident types.

    **Requires 'Agent', 'Admin', or 'EndUser' role.** EndUsers can use this to get a preliminary classification for their own submitted tickets.
